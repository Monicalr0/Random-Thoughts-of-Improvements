# Random-Thoughts-of-Improvements
Some thoughts I came across when using certain app. Reminds myself for future development lol. 

## Google Calendar
 * Auto time recognition. When I tried to input course code (e.g. CSC101) for a whole day event, the event would be saved as happening at 1:01 - 2:01 of that day. It would be better to have it recgonize certain pattern as time(e.g. 1:01 instead of 101). Also if a user want to create a event at certain time slot why would he/she use whole day event to start with.
